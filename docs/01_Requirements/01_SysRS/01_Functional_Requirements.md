| FR ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-ANA-03-1 | The system shall generate a Mermaid-based visual behavior diagram (e.g., a sequence diagram) from a recorded session's captured events, so analysts can understand a device's communication flow at a glance instead of manually reading the raw timeline, and so the diagram can be dropped directly into a client report. | Should | A Mermaid diagram is produced that reflects the session's captured events and renders correctly in a standard Mermaid viewer. |
| FR-ANA-03-2 | The system shall represent correlated communication events as linked steps within the diagram (e.g., in a sequence diagram, a login attempt's HTTP request and the I2C read it triggers on the DUT appear as connected messages between the same pair of lifelines), so analysts can easily see how events are connected without checking the raw session. | Should | For a known correlated event pair in the test session, both events appear in the diagram as visually linked/connected elements rather than disconnected entries. |


---

| FR-ANA-04-5 | The system shall allow an analyst to export the reconstructed memory map (e.g., binary/hex dump). | Should | The memory map can be exported and opened externally. |
| FR-ANA-04-6 | The system shall allow an analyst to choose which of the following to include in a single consolidated report: recorded session data, detected sensitive-data findings , custom search results , and the generated diagram  — exported in one or more report-ready formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX). | Should | The analyst can select any combination of session data, findings, custom search results, and generated diagrams, and the exported file, in a supported report-ready format, contains only the selected items. |

![Export Session Options](./export_report_options-dark.svg)

![Reconstructed memory map view with export control](./memory_map_export_view-dark.svg)

---

### Assumptions & Dependencies
- Accurate search/flagging depends on reliable timestamps from time sync (FR-MON-04).
- Session storage/format depends on BR-DEP export-import design (FR-DEP-02-x).
- At-rest protection of exported findings depends on FR-SEC-01 (encryption at rest).
- The finding count metric (FR-ANA-06-4) depends on the flagging logic defined in FR-ANA-05-1; changes to detection patterns will affect the reported count.

### Open Questions
- What default credential/token patterns should auto-flagging (FR-ANA-05-1) detect out of the box?
- What diagram type(s)/tooling will be used to generate behavior diagrams (FR-ANA-03-1)?
- Which export formats will be supported for v1 (FR-ANA-04)?
- BR-ANA-01 does not define behavior if an analyst leaves a session running indefinitely (e.g., forgets to stop it) — should there be a maximum session duration, an idle timeout, or is indefinite recording acceptable?

## BR-ACT — Actions
Derived from Business Requirements **BR-ACT-01** and **BR-ACT-03**.
---

### 1. Active Reconnaissance Workflow

| ID | Functional Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| **FR-ACT-01.1** | The system shall provide a dedicated "Active Reconnaissance" mode, distinct from passive observation mode, which the analyst must explicitly enter before any active action can be initiated. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-01.2** | Upon initiating any active reconnaissance action, the system shall display a confirmation dialog that clearly states: (a) the action to be performed, (b) the target DUT identifier, (c) the potential impact on DUT state, and (d) requires the analyst to explicitly confirm (e.g., typed confirmation or dual-button approval) before execution. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-01.3** | The system shall log all active reconnaissance actions with timestamp, analyst identity, action type, DUT target, and confirmation event into an immutable audit trail. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-01.4** | During and after an active reconnaissance action, the system shall simultaneously capture and record the DUT's response across all connected capture nodes (wired, wireless, on-board buses) for subsequent analysis. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-01.5** | The system shall allow the analyst to abort an active reconnaissance action mid-execution if the action type supports interruption (e.g., canceling a signal replay), with an immediate notification of partial completion. | Should |

---

### 2. Trigger Output Mechanisms

| ID | Functional Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| **FR-ACT-03.1** | The system shall provide a hardware control interface capable of asserting a reset signal or power-cycling the DUT via a controllable power switch/relay connected to the capture infrastructure. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-03.2** | The system shall support generation of configurable GPIO pulses (level, duration, pin selection) to the DUT, with parameters editable by the analyst prior to confirmation. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-03.3** | The system shall support generation or replay of wireless signals (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, proprietary RF) through connected SDR or radio capture nodes, using analyst-provided or pre-recorded signal profiles. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-03.4** | The system shall support generation or replay of on-board protocol frames (e.g., SPI, I2C, UART, CAN, JTAG) through the capture nodes, with configurable payload, timing, and bus parameters. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-03.5** | For each trigger action in FR-ACT-03.1–03.4, the system shall require the analyst to explicitly configure all parameters and review a summary before the confirmation step in FR-ACT-01.2 is presented. | Must |
| **FR-ACT-03.6** | The system shall validate configured trigger parameters against the DUT's declared capabilities/connections and warn the analyst if a misconfiguration is detected (e.g., GPIO pin not connected, unsupported protocol). | Should |
| **FR-ACT-03.7** | The system shall maintain a library of reusable trigger profiles (pre-configured signal/protocol templates) that analysts can select, modify, and save for repeated use. | Should |

## BR-SEC — Security

**Source BR:** BR-SEC-01 to BR-SEC-03
**Assignee:** RA
**Status:** Completed

### Summary
The system shall protect captured session data by encrypting and password-protecting each session as a single unit. This encryption also serves as tamper-proofing: a modified session file cannot be successfully decrypted/opened, so no separate detection mechanism is needed. The system shall also support role-based access control with predefined roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer).

### Functional Requirements

| FR ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-SEC-01-1 | The system shall encrypt and password-protect each recorded session as a single unit. This encryption shall also serve as tamper-proofing, such that any modification to the encrypted file renders it unreadable/invalid. | Must | A recorded session cannot be opened or read without the correct password/key; a session file that has been modified after capture fails to decrypt/open correctly. |
| FR-SEC-03-1 | The system shall support defining roles with distinct permissions for captured session data (e.g., Admin: full access; Analyst: view, export, run analysis engines, and annotate over the timeline; Viewer: view only). | Could | At least the three defined roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer) can be assigned to users, each with the permissions described. |
| FR-SEC-03-2 | The system shall enforce role-based restrictions such that a user can only view, export, or modify session data permitted by their assigned role. | Could | A user assigned a restricted role is blocked from performing an action outside their permissions. |

### Assumptions & Dependencies
- A password/key management approach (how the session password is generated, stored, and recovered) is defined before implementation.
- Role definitions (Admin, Analyst, Viewer) and their exact permission sets are agreed upon with stakeholders prior to implementation.
- No cloud-based server is available or used for storing logs or any other data; all logging/storage stays local to the deployment.

### Open Questions
- Who sets the session password — the system automatically, or the analyst manually — and what happens if it's lost?
- Are Admin / Analyst / Viewer the only roles needed, or are additional roles expected later?

## BR-DEP — Deployment

**Source BR:** BR-DEP_01 to BR-DEP_02
**Assignee:** M
**Status:** Completed

### Summary
_The system shall run on Docker with fixed, predictable versions, and let users move their configuration and session data without losing it when containers are stopped, updated, or replaced._

### Functional Requirements

| FR ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-DEP-01-1 | System components (Core + all dependencies) shall be packaged as Docker images defined via Dockerfile(s) and orchestrated via Docker Compose. | Must | Each system component has a corresponding Dockerfile, is defined as a service in `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker compose build` completes successfully with exit code 0. |
| FR-DEP-01-2 | All image versions shall be pinned (no `:latest` tags; only locked dependency versions). | Must | Every `FROM` in all Dockerfiles and every `image:` in `docker-compose.yml` has an explicit version tag (e.g. `postgres:16.3`), not `latest`. |
| FR-DEP-01-3 | All Dockerfile install steps shall install strictly from the lockfile or `requirements.txt` with specified versions. | Must | No use of `npm install`, or unpinned `pip install`, in place of their lockfile-strict equivalents. |
| FR-DEP-02-1 | The system shall provide a function to export the current configuration and recorded session data to a file stored outside the container's writable layer. | Should | Confirm persistence after the container is stopped/removed. |
| FR-DEP-02-2 | The system shall provide a function to import previously exported configuration and recorded session data into a running or newly deployed instance. | Should | Import previously exported data into both a running instance and a freshly deployed instance; confirm the operation completes successfully in both cases. |
| FR-DEP-02-3 | The system shall log export and import operations, including timestamp and outcome (failure only). | Should | Perform successful and failed export/import operations; confirm failed operations are recorded. |

### Assumptions & Dependencies
- The application has a defined, versioned schema for configuration and session data to support import validation.
- Exported files are stored on a host-accessible path that persists independently of the container.

### Open Questions
- What are the configurations needed in import/export?
- What export/import formats are required (JSON, SQL dump, encrypted archive)?

## BR-EXT — Extensibility

**Source BR:** BR-EXT-01 to BR-EXT-02
**Assignee:** M
**Status:** Completed

### Summary
_The system shall grow to support new sniffed protocols over time, and let external capture nodes plug in as an additional data source._

### Functional Requirements

| FR ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-EXT-01-1 | Implement sniffed protocol via a modular architecture, allowing new protocol modules without modifying the core system codebase. | Should | Isolate protocol handling in separate modules with a defined interface. |
| FR-EXT-01-2 | Define a standard protocol module interface (e.g., required methods/functions for connect, parse, send, disconnect) that any new protocol implementation must conform to. | Should | Review documentation/code for a defined protocol interface (abstract class, contract, or schema); confirm an existing protocol module implements it fully. |
| FR-EXT-02-1 | Provide a documented API (e.g., REST, or similar) enabling external hardware capture tools to submit captured data to the system. | Could | Call the documented API from an external tool/script and confirm data is accepted. |
| FR-EXT-02-2 | Treat data received from external capture tools as an additional data source, processed through the same correlation/monitoring pipeline as data from native Capture Nodes. | Could | Equivalent handling for data from both the external integration interface and a native Capture Node.|
| FR-EXT-02-3 | Validate data submitted by external capture tools and mark them in view if malformed. | Could | Mark in red malformed payloads. |  
| FR-EXT-02-4 | Log failed connections and data submissions from external capture tools, including source identity, timestamp, and outcome. | Could | Failed data via the integration interface is logged with source, timestamp, and outcome. |

## BR-ENV — Non-Interference & Operating Environment

**Source BR:** BR-ENV-01 to BR-ENV-02 ,
**Assignee:** YS ,
**Status:** Completed.

### Summary
The system must behave as a passive observer during normal monitoring — never altering the DUT's behavior — and must be fully deployable and operable inside an isolated, air-gapped test-bench network, with internet access confined to initial setup only.

### Functional Requirements

| FR ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-ENV-01-1 | The system shall operate in a listen-only (passive) mode on all monitored interfaces — network, onboard-bus, and wireless — during standard monitoring sessions. | Must | No outbound transmission, injection, or signal alteration occurs on any monitored interface while in passive monitoring mode. |
| FR-ENV-01-2 | The system shall not transmit, inject, or otherwise alter any signal on a monitored interface while operating in passive monitoring mode. | Must | Electrical/timing measurements on tapped interfaces show no measurable deviation from baseline DUT behavior during passive monitoring. |
| FR-ENV-01-3 | The system shall visually indicate to the analyst which mode is currently active — passive monitoring or active reconnaissance (per FR-ACT). | Should | The active mode is clearly and unambiguously displayed in the interface at all times. |
| FR-ENV-01-4 | The system shall apply the non-interference constraint only while operating in Passive Monitoring mode. When operating in Active Reconnaissance mode the system shall permit authorized actions that intentionally interact with the Device Under Test (DUT), provided they have been explicitly confirmed by the analyst. | Must | Active reconnaissance actions execute normally and are not blocked or flagged by non-interference checks. |
| FR-ENV-02-1 | The system shall support live monitoring without requiring an outbound or inbound internet connection during runtime. | Must | Live monitoring operates correctly while the test-bench network is disconnected from the internet. |
| FR-ENV-02-2 | The system shall perform event correlation without requiring an outbound or inbound internet connection during runtime. | Must | Event correlation functions correctly while the test-bench network is disconnected from the internet. |
| FR-ENV-02-3 | The system shall record sessions without requiring an outbound or inbound internet connection during runtime. | Must | Session recording operates correctly while the test-bench network is disconnected from the internet. |
| FR-ENV-02-4 | The system shall execute active reconnaissance functions without requiring an outbound or inbound internet connection during runtime. | Must | Active reconnaissance functions operate correctly while the test-bench network is disconnected from the internet. |
| FR-ENV-02-5 | The system shall not require an outbound or inbound internet connection for normal runtime operation. | Must | All runtime functions remain fully operational with the test-bench network disconnected from the internet. |
| FR-ENV-02-6 | The system shall not depend on any internet-hosted service (e.g., license checks, telemetry, update checks) during normal operation. | Must | No outbound requests to external/internet-hosted endpoints are observed during normal operation. |
| FR-ENV-02-7 | The system's time synchronization mechanism (per FR-MON-04) shall use only a local network time reference, not an internet-hosted PTP source. | Must | The configured time reference server resides within the isolated test-bench network. |
| FR-ENV-02-8 | The system may require internet access solely during initial installation/setup (e.g., pulling container images ), and this exception shall be explicitly documented. | Must | Documentation clearly states which setup steps require internet access and confirms no such dependency exists post-setup. |

### Assumptions & Dependencies
- The monitoring hardware is correctly connected to the DUT.
- The deployment environment provides local networking between the Core and Capture Nodes.
- Docker images and required dependencies are downloaded before deployment into an air-gapped environment.

### Open Questions
- Will software updates also support fully offline installation?
- What operating systems are officially supported for deployment?
- What quantitative threshold (e.g., timing/electrical tolerance) defines "no interference" for passive taps on each protocol?
- Is there a need to detect and alert if an outbound internet call is attempted during normal operation, or is documentation-only compliance sufficient for the first release?

- UAT scenarios are derived from the Must-priority requirements across all BR categories (MON, ANA, ACT, SEC, ENV, DEP, EXT).
- Designated stakeholder(s) authorized to grant sign-off are identified before UAT begins.
- Training is delivered before production deployment.

### Open Questions
- Who is responsible for approving UAT?
- Will training be instructor-led, self-paced, or both?
- What is the minimum number/coverage of real DUT scenarios required for UAT to be considered representative?
